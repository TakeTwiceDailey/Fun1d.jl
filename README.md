## Overview

The `DDF` package discretizes functions on arbitrary domains. The
domain is decomposed into simplices, and the function is represented
via a basis in each simplex. This is a form of a Finite Element
discretization. For example, a scalar function in two dimensions might
be represented via its values at the vertices. In between the vertices
it might be defined via linear interpolation.

The `DDF` package is based on
[FEEC](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/), the Finite Element
Exterior Calculus. FEEC bears a certain similarity to
[DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_exterior_calculus), the
Discrete Exterior Calculus.

The design goals of the `DDF` package are:
- supports unstructured meshes (e.g. simplices)
- works in arbitrary dimensions
- supports higher order accurate discretizations
- is efficient enough for parallel/distributed calculations with large
  meshes with billions of elements
- is flexible and relatively easy to use so that it is useful for
  experimental mathematics

The `DDF` package is currently (2020-10-17) work in progress.
Functionality is missing, and the current API is too tedious (too many
details need to be specified explicitly).

## Examples

Define a 2d manifold with `Float64` coordinates that consists of a
single simplex:
```Julia
using DDF
D = 2
mfd = simplex_manifold(Val(D), Float64)
mfd = refined_manifold(mfd);
mfd = refined_manifold(mfd);
```

Calculate the gradient operator for the primal mesh:
```Julia
grad = deriv(Val(Pr), Val(0), mfd)
```

Calculate the hodge dual operator for scalars on the primal mesh:
```Julia
h = hodge(Val(Pr), Val(0), mfd)
```

Define a scalar function living on the primal vertices:
```Julia
using DifferentialForms
f(x) = Form{D,0}((sin(x[1]) * cos(x[2]), ))
f̃ = sample(Fun{D,Pr,0,D,Float64,Float64}, f, mfd)
```

Plot the scalar function:
```Julia
using AbstractPlotting
using GLMakie
using StaticArrays

coordinates = [mfd.coords[0][i][d] for i in 1:nsimplices(mfd, 0), d in 1:D]
connectivity = [SVector{D + 1}(i
                               for i in sparse_column_rows(mfd.simplices[D], j))
                for j in 1:size(mfd.simplices[D], 2)];
connectivity = [connectivity[i][n]
                for i in 1:nsimplices(mfd, D), n in 1:(D + 1)]
color = f̃.values;

scene = Scene()
poly!(scene, coordinates, connectivity, color=color, strokecolor=(:black, 0.6),
      strokewidth=4)
scale!(scene, 1, 1)

# using Makie
# Makie.save("simplex.png", scene; resolution=(350,300))
```
